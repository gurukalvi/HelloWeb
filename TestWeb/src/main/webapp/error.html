        <p>We're sorry, but our server is currently taking a nap. It's been working really hard, and now it needs a break.</p>
        <p>Please try refreshing the page, and if that doesn't work, you can tell our server a joke to wake it up:</p>
        <p>Why did the server go to therapy?<br>Because it had too many issues!</p>

        <p>If the server is still asleep, you can contact our support team, but they might be napping too.</p>
